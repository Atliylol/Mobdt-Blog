## The first of many? <span style="font-size: 8px; opacity: .7">Probably not</span>

Heyyy... atliylol here, and this is the fist Mobdt devlog, it's not weekly or monthly, it's when i want to.

Well, I haven't done much stuff this month, i took a break, it's not that easy keeping it up without a burnout. But, as you can see i'm here!

<br>

However, i need people! The team is made up of 3 people, me, and two betatesters, as you can see, i do basically everything, and i need more team members, betatesters not included since i already have some and that's not what i need now, if you wanna join, you can always [contact us](mailto:teaminundation@gmail.com)
