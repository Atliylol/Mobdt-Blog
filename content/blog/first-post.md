Yeah i'm going to post progress, news and stuff about Mobdt here since twitter bad
Also this blog is still in W.I.P so don't expect too much of it for now... but just for now ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘»

I personally don't like comments because i like to say whatever i want and people just accept it ok? <p style="font-size: 8px;">"yes!" you said.</p>
